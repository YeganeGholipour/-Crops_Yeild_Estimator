# Crops Yield Estimator

## In this project we need to estimate the crops based on features such as rain, pesticides, temperature,... .

### I use regression algorithms such as: 
1. Gradient Boosting Regressor 
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. Decision Tree Regressor
4. KNeighbors Regressor

A User Interface also have been designed.

### Libraries used in this project:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn
6. scipy
7. tkinter (for UI)
